# Little Shop FE

### Abstract:
This application is a Merchant & Items dashboard built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that allows users to view, add, edit, delete, and sort merchants and their items. It solves the problem of manually managing merchant data by providing an interactive front-end interface that syncs with a backend API. Features like sorting merchants alphabetically and client-side form validation enhance usability and prevent errors during data entry.

### Context:
This was a short-term front-end project completed over a few days. The goal was to practice DOM manipulation and API integration using vanilla JavaScript.
David and I worked directly to the following features:

Implemented merchant sorting alphabetically

Improved styling for better visual clarity and navigation

Refactored two methods in Javasrcipt to use prototype methods
