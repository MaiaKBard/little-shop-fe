# Little Shop | Group Project | Frontend Starter Repo

This Little Shop FE Group Project Boilerplate is built to consume and display the data from the BE Rails API built in the Mod 2 Group Project.  

Your group will pull down and continue building out your own version of this front end application.

## Set Up Instructions

**Note:** Do **not** clone this repo into your backend repo. Put it somewhere else as a stand alone. The BE and FE repos will remain two separate repos and you will submit the links to each.  

1. Fork repo
1. Clone forked repo and rename it `git clone <repo> <new name>` (Do not clone this into your BE repo. See note above.)
1. `cd` into cloned repo
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run dev` to start developing.
  1. You'll see in the terminal that the project has opened at "http://localhost:5173/"


## Notes

This FE application is build to consume the data from your Rails API.  In order for it to work, you must have your Rails API running on localhost:3000. You will see fetch errors when running the FE without the BE API up and running.  

Follow the directions in the FE requirements portion of the Little Shop group project spec. When you are finished with the FE work, update this README to remove the current content and follow the template below.

### Abstract:
This application is a Merchant & Items dashboard built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that allows users to view, add, edit, delete, and sort merchants and their items. It solves the problem of manually managing merchant data by providing an interactive front-end interface that syncs with a backend API. Features like sorting merchants alphabetically and client-side form validation enhance usability and prevent errors during data entry.

### Installation Instructions:
1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Run npm install if dependencies are listed.

3. Run npm run dev then paste this in URL http://localhost:5173 in your browser to launch the app.

4. Ensure your backend is running and accessible rails s

### Preview of App:
Gif!!!
### Context:
This was a short-term front-end project completed over a few days. The goal was to practice DOM manipulation and API integration using vanilla JavaScript.
David and I worked directly to the following features:

Implemented merchant sorting alphabetically

Improved styling for better visual clarity and navigation

Refactored two methods in Javasrcipt to use prototype methods

### Wins + Challenges:
(What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:

 - Refacoted two methods and got it work!

 - Implemented a working alphabetical sort feature

Challenges:

 - Debugging the sorting logic — learning localeCompare to allow comparision of strings

 - Ensuring the sort button only shows on the correct view — fixed with conditional DOM rendering
