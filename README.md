# Little Shop FE

### Abstract:
This application is a Merchant & Items dashboard built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that allows users to view, add, edit, delete, and sort merchants and their items. It solves the problem of manually managing merchant data by providing an interactive front-end interface that syncs with a backend API. Features like sorting merchants alphabetically and client-side form validation enhance usability and prevent errors during data entry.
